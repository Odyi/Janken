Welcome to the Janken: 
This project is a unique twist on the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, developed by myself and my fellow classmate and friend. 
Inspired by the challenging and intense atmosphere of the Dark Souls series, this version brings a new level of excitement and difficulty to the age-old game.
I had to zip the code since we used a lot of gifs and images for this project and it made the file too large, for example since me and my friend arent really good animators
we used free gifs around the internet to create a living menu screen, we also used free gifs for the characters and put them in aseprite and animated them a bit.
this game took us around 3 days to make we had mandatory rules that we needed to use atleast 2 days to plan ahead.
The documention for the game is norwegian.
